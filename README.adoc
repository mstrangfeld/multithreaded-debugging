* "If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." ~ Edsger W. Dijkstra
* "Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?" ~ Brian Kernighan
* "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements." ~ Brian Kernighan
